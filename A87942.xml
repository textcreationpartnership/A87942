         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Affaires here goe on peaceably and ≈øilently, the work of Disbanding in the≈øe Northern Counties being fini≈øhed, except onely one Company of Foot in <hi>We≈øtmerland,</hi> which had al≈øo been done before now, with the re≈øt, but

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Lately writ a large Letter unto you with others, from your friends in <hi>Bandon,</hi> inclo≈øed and ≈øent by one Mr. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> a ≈øervant to major generall <hi>Jep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,</hi> which I hope are delivered you.</p>
            <p>In that Letter I acquainted you, that my Lord had marched into the Countie of <hi>Limrick</hi> and <hi>Kerye</hi> and di≈øtroyed all he came at, di≈ø-inabling them to aide the enemy: his men and hor≈øe being wearied out, he came home, but ≈øtayed not above fourteen dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was for≈øt out by wants, to look for a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood for his men another way, he marched to <hi>Caker</hi> Ca≈øtle that was in ≈øome di≈øtre≈ø≈øe and releived it. That night being ready to lye downe to ≈øleepe, he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that my Lord <hi>Taffe</hi> and others would bee that night at <hi>Carrick,</hi> and ≈øome boates laden to goe from <hi>Clomell</hi> to <hi>Waterford:</hi> My Lord pre≈øently made ready, and could at pre≈øent get but 300 Hor≈øe, with tho≈øe he went him≈øelfe in per≈øon, and gave order for the re≈øt of the Hor≈øe and Foote to follow him, hee came before day to <hi>Carick,</hi> and with tho≈øe few Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers got over the <hi>Wale,</hi> took both the Towne, Ca≈øtle and the boate, but my Lord <hi>Taffe</hi> was not there. In the boate was good pillage. And my Lord broke two ≈øwords to pre≈øerve it, but could not from the Hor≈øe and Foote.</p>
            <p>After my Lord had put in a Governour and ≈øettled a Gari≈øon, he marched to <hi>Calien</hi> and took the Towne and two Ca≈øtles there with the lo≈ø≈øe of a Captaine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161519:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 65 -->and ten Souldiers which they paid deare for, for my Lord put above 300 of them to the ≈øword.</p>
            <p>My Lord ≈øtill lies there and hath de≈øtroyed home to the City of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and hath and will de≈øtroy all in both the Counties of <hi>Tipporary,</hi> and <hi>Kilken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> which was the nur≈øery and grainary of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, All this affords but a pre≈øent livelihood for the men that are abroad with my Lord, and many of them daily dye with cold, for want of cloathing. The <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> know our wants as well as we our ≈øelves, and are making ready all the force they can again≈øt us, and if we be not ≈øpeedily ≈øupplied with men, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, cloathes, armes and amunition I fear the whole Province will be lo≈øt, if we lo≈øe it, the getting of our towne again, will co≈øt more then the getting of the whole Province would now, for they are at pre≈øent ≈øo much di≈øtracted, that if they ≈øaw but con≈øiderable ≈øupply come to us, the better ≈øort would leave the Kingdome and runne away, my Lord hath written ≈øeverall Letters to Collonell <hi>Jones</hi> to meete him with his Forces and hath received an≈øwer from him, but the great raines hath ≈øo ≈øwolen the Rivers that they cannot as yet meet, but I hope they will ≈øhortly, and then I hope you ≈øhall heare that <hi>Kilkenny</hi> is taken and ≈øome others places.</p>
